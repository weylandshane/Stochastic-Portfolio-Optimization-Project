•	Examined a Bayesian non-parametric inference approach to optimize diversity-weighted portfolios to tackle the challenges inherent in Stochastic Portfolio Theory (Python)
•	Applied Markov Chain Monte Carlo to optimize portfolio parameters, reached average yearly return of 56.9% and Sharpe Ratio of 1.02 in back testing period 2008-2022

In this paper, we provided a comprehensive analysis of diversityweighted
portfolios within Stochastic Portfolio Theory (SPT). We examined
the application and effectiveness of Bayesian non-parametric
methods, particularly in addressing challenges inherent in SPT, like
market imperfections and model limitations. The study compared
Frequentist and Bayesian parametric inference methods in portfolio
optimization and explored the impact of negative parameter values
on portfolio returns. Empirical analysis included the evaluation of
portfolio performance using data from the S&P 500 index, assessing
the merits of diversity-weighted portfolios with both positive and negative
parameters.
